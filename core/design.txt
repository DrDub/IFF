architecture

block diagram

core:
 basic object interfaces
 object interaction logic
 rules/constraints
 observation apis (i.e. what is visible, can i go somewhere, etc)
 natural language parser, compiler, executor
 game state manager (serialized/atomic/etc)

universe:
 idea is that the same server+core can run many different games defined in different universes
 game objects (expressed as scala objects)
 state initialization
 custom game rules

server:
 uses core
 uses universe
 web server user interface
 player administration
